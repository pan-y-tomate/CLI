# zk-pos-cli

Command Line Interface to use the pan-y-tomate Proof Of Solvency Tooling. You only need to provide a csv file with the user_id and the amount of tokens they hold and the CLI will generate a proof for each user and verify it.

## Usage

The CLI comprises of three execs:

**`init-mst`**

```bash
$ node src/cli init-mst data.csv mst.json
```

Parse the csv file provided as input (`data.csv`) into a Merkle Sum Tree and saves it in a json file provided as output `mst.json`. The csv file should be in the format of `userID,balance` (see [test/data.csv](./test/data.csv) for example).

**`gen-proof`**

```bash
$ node src/cli gen-proof mst.json proof.json public.json 1 2000
```

Starting from the data structure provided as input (`mst.json`), generate a proof for the user with index `1` in the csv file. The total assets held by the exchange is `2000`.
The proof is saved in a json file provided as output (`proof.json`). The public signals is also saved in a json file provided as output (`public.json`)

> Note that the `index` is not the same as the `userID`. The `index` is the position of the user in the csv file. The first user will have index 0, an so on... The `userID` is the value of the first column of the csv file.

The proof is generated using the artificats generated by the trusted setup executed by the pan-y-tomate team. The artifacts are located in the `artifacts` folder.

**`verify-proof`**

```bash
$ node src/cli verify-proof proof.json public.json
```

Starting from the proof provided as input (`proof.json`) and the public signals provided as input (`public.json`), the user can verify their own proof. The user is still required to check whether the public signals are correct. This is an exampel of the output of a succesfully verified proof:

```bash
Verification OK
Does this match the public root hash? 10282595180566643423269555543735649507136102163748745566772565484813750476731
Does this match the total assets owned by the CEX? 10000
Does this match the poseidon hash of your used ID and your balance? 1775921064485816613880388139942630078405276839580141761238454556829307809371
Does this match your balance in the exchange? 665
```
