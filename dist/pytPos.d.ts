 * PytPos is a class that contains the core methods to let CEXs provide credible Proof Of Solvency to its users
 * while maintaining secrecy over their Business Information thanks to zkSNARKs.
 * The exchange first needs to create a Merkle Sum Tree from a csv file containing the username and balances of its users.
 * Then, it can generate a proof of solvency for a specific user using a zkSNARK.
 * The proof of solvency is generated by providing the Merkle Sum Tree, the user's index in the Merkle Sum Tree, the total assets owned by the exchange and the prover artifacts.
 * The proof doesn't reveal information such as the total balances of each users, the number of users and total amount of liabilities are not revealed to the public.
 * The PytPos class also provides methods such that the user can verify the proof of solvency.
